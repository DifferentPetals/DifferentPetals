      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are a group that wants to help black LGBTQ+, Black femmes, and Black women ages 16 and up. Our goal is to advocate and support these communities' health, wellness, and safety. These communities are constantly affected by STIs, physical harm, trauma, and mental health issues. We want to be that change in Columbus Ohio. According to The Ohio Department of Health website, the rate of new diagnoses among Black/African American people was nearly eight times higher than that among white people. According to the Trevor Project 35% of people reported seriously considering suicide in the past 12 months, and 19% reported a past year suicide attempt. In the year 2011, 61% of sexual violence was against youth, the youngest age being 15. Referring to the National Sexual violence center, 63% of these crimes were not reported. These are the issues that impact these communities the most. They have little attention brought to them because of the social stigma that the Black LGBTQ+ community face daily and the invisibility of Black women’s voices. Columbus already has a small number of organizations centered around Black LGBTQ+ and Black Women but all with little recognition. Our main goal is to support both of these communities within their everyday lives, being able to guide them to resources, while also being that resource. Within all of our years in high school, We all have witnessed the damage of mass hysteria and miseducation on STIs, gender, and sexuality. Also after witnessing such events take place, we realized that mass hysteria doesn’t stop in high school. Therefore, We aligned our interests to create something that could relieve so many with the support of some who see our vision.</p>
      
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health:</strong> We plan to create a website that will be the beating heart of our organization. Through the website, those affected by these things will be able to find resources. Not just basic articles you can find on google but of different people within the city who can relate to their hardships.</li>
        <li><strong>Wellness:</strong> We as a group truly believe that health is wealth! We are in these bodies until the day we pass on, so why not take care of them? However, we do realize that some have access to better health care rather than others. Or some may be afraid to seek medical treatment because of judgment, bias/unfair treatment, or simply being misunderstood. According to the U.S. Department Of Labor Blog, the likelihood of dying from a pregnancy-related cause is 2.5 times higher for a Black woman in this country than for a white woman.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety is a big issue in black LGBTQ+ and black female communities. As a group, we realize this. We want to create awareness and help find resources on how to stay safe. A section of our website will be on safety awareness issues around the city of Columbus. This section will also include a wide range of resources on how to stay safe.</li>

      <h2>A Little More About Us</h2>
      <h3>Precious Smith</h3>
      <p>Who am I? I am a black woman. Who am I? I am a woman. Who am I? I am here to pour out into others. My name is Precious Smith. I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. Growing up on the south side of Columbus, I have seen, heard, and experienced many things. I ride in my car sometimes and wonder about the stories that each stranger could share. I have a desire to be more involved within my community. There is information that needs to be heard and shared. My goal with the organization is to bring awareness about multiple diseases, social issues, stigmas, and biases that affect our community surrounding health. Please don't be afraid to shoot me an email if you have any questions. Be sure to let me know what I can do to help you. We can figure it out together because that is what I am here for. I will be sure to provide all I can to help!</p>
      
      <h3>Donovyn Stevens</h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Donovyn Stevens. I’ve lived in Columbus, Ohio and have seen the ignorance and blissful negligence the institutions have shown black LGBTQ+ and black women. Being part of the community and also a student in STEM, I want to guide others like me into safe environments that promote freedom of expression and also display the importance of education and science. So many of us are deterred from STEM careers because of the lack of representation and the negative connotations of our profession within the workplace. In many ways, growing up, I felt unsafe and not entitled to protection in high school, and I wouldn’t want other youth or adults to go through the same.</p>
      
      <h3>Jameson King</h3>
      <p>Hello everyone, my name is Jameson King, and I am an bisexual black man. I was born and raised on the east side of Columbus by a single strong black woman. Living in a single-parent household, I endured many challenges and struggles, but as you can see, I made it through all of them because I am here. Learning how to take care of myself and my sister, I want to help in any way I can for people like me, especially in the black community. Going through those things in a personal aspect makes me knowledgeable in things you can’t be taught and is something you have to go through to understand.</p>
      <p>I am a Social work major and currently attend Winston-Salem State University, which is an HBCU in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. What I want to do after school is work with children in the school systems and eventually get into case management in some sort of children and family services. Why I want to be a part of this organization and my goal is to help in any way I can. I am here to not only help but to find outside help for some problems. I am here to help make their lives easier, whether it be to learn how different programs work or even if they need assistance and I can find it for them. The saying “It takes a village” is said for a reason, and I want to be a part of that village! I am here as a resource and I am passionate to be a part of this project!</p>
